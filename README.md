This repository contains a Homey app which supports Huawei Inverters and Batteries over Modbus.

The [SolarEdge + Growatt TCP modbus app](https://github.com/biemond/solaredge.modbus) which already exists for Homey adds all capabilities in one device. Because of this the energy feature of Homey cannot correctly calculate energy usage as it has no knowledge of a battery device.
